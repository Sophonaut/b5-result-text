  title: 'Agreeableness',
  shortDescription: 'Agreeableness reflects individual differences concerning cooperation and social harmony.',
  description: `Agreeable individuals value getting along with others.
  They are therefore considerate, friendly,
generous, helpful, and willing to compromise their interests with
others'. Agreeable people also have an optimistic view of human
nature. They believe people are basically honest, decent, and
trustworthy. 
<br /><br />
Disagreeable individuals place self-interest above getting along with
others. They are generally unconcerned with others' well-being, and
therefore are unlikely to extend themselves for other people.
Sometimes their skepticism about others' motives causes them to be
suspicious, unfriendly, and uncooperative.
<br /><br />
Agreeableness is obviously advantageous for attaining and maintaining
popularity. Agreeable people are better liked than disagreeable
people. On the other hand, agreeableness is not useful in situations
that require tough or absolute objective decisions.
<br /><br />
Low agreeableness (or antagonism) is tough-minded and 
hardheaded. Although agreeable people are nicer than antagonistic people, 
antagonism, too, has its virtues. We want surgeons to be ruthless in cutting 
out disease and lawyers to be aggressive in our defense.`,

      title: 'Trust',
      text: `A person scoring high in trust assumes that most people
are fair, honest, and have good intentions. This enables them to more easily
create relationships with others, but could also put them at risk of 
exploitation/wrong-doing of others who would take advantage of such a person.

<br /><br />
People low in trust often see others as selfish, devious, and potentially dangerous which
makes it difficult to form intimate relationships.`

      title: 'Straightforwardness',
      text: `High scorers on this scale see no need for
pretense or manipulation when dealing with others and are therefore
candid, frank, and sincere. People find it relatively easy to relate to 
those who score high in straightforwardness.
<br /><br />
Low scorers believe that a certain amount of deception in social relationships 
is necessary. People generally find it more difficult to relate to the low-scorers on this scale. It
should be made clear that low scorers are not unprincipled
or immoral; they are simply more guarded and less willing to openly
reveal the whole truth.`

      title: 'Altruism',
      text: `The selflessness of agreeable people is seen in their 
      considerateness and desire to help others - a facet known as
      Altruism. Those who score highly in the Altruism scale typically
       find helping other people genuinely rewarding. Consequently, they 
       are generally willing to assist those who are in need. Altruistic 
       people find that doing things for others is a form of self-fulfillment 
       rather than self-sacrifice. 
<br /><br />
Low scorers on this scale do not particularly like
helping those in need. Requests for help feel like an imposition
rather than an opportunity for self-fulfillment.`

      text: `Individuals who score high on this scale
dislike confrontations. They are perfectly willing to compromise or
to deny their own needs in order to get along with others.

Those who score low on this scale are more likely to intimidate others to
get their way.`

      title: 'Modesty',
      text: `High scorers on this scale do not like to claim
that they are better than other people. In some cases this attitude
may derive from low self-confidence or self-esteem. Nonetheless,
some people with high self-esteem find immodesty unseemly. 
<br /><br />
Low scorers in Modesty are more willing to describe themselves as superior and tend to
be seen as disagreeably arrogant, or narcissistic, by other people.`

      title: 'Tender-mindedness',
      text: `People who score high on this scale are
tenderhearted and compassionate. They feel the pain of others
vicariously and are easily moved to pity.
<br /><br />
Low scorers tend not to be affected as strongly by human suffering. They pride themselves on
making objective judgments based on reason. They are more concerned
with truth and impartial justice than with mercy.`
