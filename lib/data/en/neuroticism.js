  title: 'Neuroticism',
  shortDescription: 'Neuroticism refers to the tendency to experience negative feelings and thoughts.',
  description: `"Neuroticism represents the proneness of the individual to experience 
  unpleasant and disturbing emotions and to have corresponding disturbances in 
  thoughts and actions (book pg 46)" 
 <br /><br />
People high in neuroticism are emotionally reactive. They
respond emotionally to events that would not affect most people, and
their reactions tend to be more intense than normal. They are more
likely to interpret ordinary situations as threatening, and minor
frustrations as hopelessly difficult. 
<br /><br />
Their negative emotional reactions tend to persist for unusually long periods of time, which
means they are often in a bad mood. These problems in emotional
regulation can diminish a neurotic's ability to think clearly, make
decisions, and cope effectively with stress.
<br /><br />
"In general, those high in Neuroticism are likely to be high in each of the facets. 
They are prone to violent and negative emotions that interfere with their ability to deal 
with their problems and to get along with others (book pg 48)."
<br /><br />
An example of how these facets can easily cascade into each other is as follows: 
â€œIn social situations they are anxious and embarrassed, and their frustration in 
dealing with others may make them hostile, further complicating matters. In compensation, 
they turn to the use of alcohol or food, and the long-term results are likely to be depressing."
<br /><br />
The first four facets (anxiety, angry hostility, depression, and self-consciousness) more often present
themselves as emotional states, while the final two facets (impulsiveness and vulnerability) appear
as behaviors.`,

      title: 'Anxiety',
      text: `The "fight-or-flight" system of the brain of anxious
individuals is more easily and more often engaged. Therefore, people who
are high in anxiety tend to worry more about what might go wrong.
They may be afraid of specific situations or be just generally fearful.
They feel tense, jittery, and nervous. Persons low in Anxiety are generally
calm and fearless.`

      title: 'Angry Hostility',
      text: `People who score high in Angry Hostility feel enraged when
things do not go their way. They tend to be irritable and ill tempered, and 
may prove hard to get along with. Whether or not 
someone expresses annoyance and hostility depends on the individual's
level on Agreeableness. Low scorers do not get angry often or easily.`

      facet: 3,
      title: 'Depression',
      text: `As a trait, Depression measures the tendency to feel sad, hopeless, lonely
      and discouraged. Depressed people often have feelings of guilt and of diminished self-worth.
       High scorers lack energy and have difficulty initiating
activities. Low scorers tend to be free from these depressive feelings.`

    {
      facet: 4,
      title: 'Self-Consciousness',
      text: `Self-conscious individuals are sensitive
about what others think of them. Their concern about rejection and
ridicule causes them to feel shy and uncomfortable around others. Self-Consciousness 
is often called shyness, but it should be noted that people who are shy in this 
respect do not necessarily avoid people. Introverts often claim to be shy when in fact they simply 
do not care to interact with others; they claim shyness as an excuse.

Self-conscious people are easily embarrassed and often feel ashamed. Their fears that others
will criticize or make fun of them are exaggerated and unrealistic, but
their awkwardness and discomfort may make these fears a self-fulfilling
prophecy. 

Low scorers, in contrast, do not suffer from the mistaken
impression that everyone is watching and judging them. They tend to feel
less nervous in social situations.`

      facet: 5,
      title: 'Impulsiveness',
      text: `Impulsive individuals feel strong cravings and
are more easily overwhelmed by desires. They tend to be
oriented toward short-term pleasures and rewards rather than long-
term consequences. Because they have so little control (or perhaps because they experience such strong urges), 
impulsive people tend to overeat and overspend, to drink and smoke, gamble, and perhaps use drugs.

Low scorers do not experience strong, irresistible
cravings and consequently do not find themselves tempted to overindulge.`

      facet: 6,
      title: 'Vulnerability',
      text: `Vulnerability defines the inability to deal adequately with stress.
      High scorers on Vulnerability experience
panic, confusion, and helplessness when under pressure or stress.

Low scorers feel more poised, confident, and clear-thinking when
stressed.`
