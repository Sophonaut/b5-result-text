  title: 'Openness To Experience',
  shortDescription: 'Openness to Experience differentiates those who tend to be imaginative and creative, from those who are more conventional and down-to-earth///////.',
  description: `Open people are intellectually curious,
appreciative of art, and sensitive to beauty. They tend to be,
compared to closed people, more aware of their feelings. They tend to
think and act in individualistic and nonconforming
ways. Intellectuals typically score high on Openness to Experience;
consequently, this factor has also been called Culture or
Intellect. <br /><br />Nonetheless, Intellect is probably best regarded as one aspect of openness
to experience. Scores on Openness to Experience are only modestly
related to years of education and scores on standard intelligent tests.
<br /><br />
Another characteristic of the open cognitive style is a facility for thinking
in symbols and abstractions far removed from concrete experience. Depending on
the individual's specific intellectual abilities, this symbolic cognition may
take the form of mathematical, logical, or geometric thinking, artistic and
metaphorical use of language, music composition or performance, or one of the
many visual or performing arts.
<br /><br />
People with low scores on openness to experience tend to have narrow, common
interests. They prefer the plain, straightforward, and obvious over the
complex, ambiguous, and subtle. They may regard the arts and sciences with
suspicion, regarding these endeavors as obscure or of no practical use.
Closed people prefer familiarity over novelty; they are conservative and
resistant to change.
<br /><br />
Openness is often presented as healthier or more mature by psychologists, who
are often themselves open to experience. However, open and closed styles of
thinking are useful in different environments. The intellectual style of the
open person may serve a professor well, but research has shown that closed
thinking is related to superior job performance in police work, sales, and
a number of service occupations.

CLEAN UP LATER:
Low: down-to-earth, uncreative, conventional, prefer routine, uncurious, conservative
High: imaginative, creative, original, prefer variety, curious, liberal

General: cite from book "* Openness in our model should not be confused with self-disclosure 
(being willing to talk about ones inner feelings); instead, it refers to a 
receptiveness to new ideas, approaches, and experiences.
* People who are closed to experience are not necessarily defensive, 
nor are they necessarily narrow minded in the sense of being judgmental 
and intolerant. Instead, they are characterized by a preference for the 
familiar, practical, and concrete, and a lack of interest in experience for 
its own sake."`,

      text: `Openness to values refers to a willingness to consider alternate possibilities and 
      empathize with others in different circumstances. High scorers tend to challenge convention
      and traditional values, prefer ambiguity, and in extreme cases support chaos and disorder. 
      They are able to update their beliefs regularly, but this can put them at risk of becoming 
      nihilistic (assuming there is no meaning to life). Low scorers prefer the security and 
      stability brought by maintaining tradition, but this can put them at risk of not being able
      to update their values or consider the values of others beliefs.`
