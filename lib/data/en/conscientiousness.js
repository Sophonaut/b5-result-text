  title: 'Conscientiousness',
  shortDescription: 'Conscientiousness concerns the way in which we control, regulate, and direct our impulses.',
  description: `Conscientiousness is a dimension of individual differences in organization and achievement. 
  Highly conscientious people are dutiful and self-disciplined, but also ambitious and hardworking, 
  sometimes to the point of being "workaholics."
  <br /><br/>
  People who score high on the
  Conscientiousness scale are often perceived by others as intelligent. 
  A hallmark of intelligence is the ability to think about future
consequences before acting on an impulse. Intelligent activity
involves contemplation of long-range goals, organizing and planning
routes to these goals, and persisting toward one's goals in the face
of short-lived impulses to the contrary. The idea that intelligence
involves impulse control is nicely captured by the term prudence, an
alternative label for the Conscientiousness domain. Prudent means
both wise and cautious. Conscientious individuals tend to avoid trouble 
and achieve high levels of success through
  purposeful planning and persistence. They are also positively
  regarded by others as reliable. On the negative
  side, they can be compulsive perfectionists and workaholics.
  Furthermore, extremely conscientious individuals might be regarded
  as stuffy and boring.
  <br /><br />
People who score low in Conscientiousness may be criticized for
their unreliability, lack of ambition, and failure to stay within
the lines. Compounded over the long term, being low in conscientiousness
can result in less goals achieved an lower life satisfaction. On
the positive side, low conscientious people will experience many short-lived pleasures and
they will never be called stuffy.
